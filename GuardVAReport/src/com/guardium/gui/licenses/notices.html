                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
                       Version 2, June 1991<br>
<br>
 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,<br>
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA<br>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim 
copies<br>
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
                            Preamble<br>
<br>
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away 
your<br>
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU 
General Public<br>
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and 
change free<br>
software--to make sure the software is free for all its 
users.  This<br>
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software<br>
Foundation's software and to any other program whose 
authors commit to<br>
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is 
covered by<br>
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can 
apply it to<br>
your programs, too.<br>
<br>
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to 
freedom, not<br>
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make 
sure that you<br>
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and 
charge for<br>
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or 
can get it<br>
if you want it, that you can change the software or use 
pieces of it<br>
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these 
things.<br>
<br>
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that 
forbid<br>
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender 
the rights.<br>
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities 
for you if you<br>
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.<br>
<br>
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, 
whether<br>
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the 
rights that<br>
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or 
can get the<br>
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they 
know their<br>
rights.<br>
<br>
  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the 
software, and<br>
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission 
to copy,<br>
distribute and/or modify the software.<br>
<br>
  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to 
make certain<br>
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for 
this free<br>
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and 
passed on, we<br>
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the 
original, so<br>
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on 
the original<br>
authors' reputations.<br>
<br>
  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by 
software<br>
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors 
of a free<br>
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect 
making the<br>
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it 
clear that any<br>
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not 
licensed at all.<br>
<br>
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, 
distribution and<br>
modification follow.<br>
<br>
                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND 
MODIFICATION<br>
<br>
  0. This License applies to any program or other work 
which contains<br>
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be 
distributed<br>
under the terms of this General Public License.  The 
"Program", below,<br>
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on 
the Program"<br>
means either the Program or any derivative work under 
copyright law:<br>
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion 
of it,<br>
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated 
into another<br>
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without 
limitation in<br>
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as 
"you".<br>
<br>
Activities other than copying, distribution and 
modification are not<br>
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The 
act of<br>
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from 
the Program<br>
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on 
the<br>
Program (independent of having been made by running the 
Program).<br>
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.<br>
<br>
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the 
Program's<br>
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that 
you<br>
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an 
appropriate<br>
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact 
all the<br>
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of 
any warranty;<br>
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this 
License<br>
along with the Program.<br>
<br>
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a 
copy, and<br>
you may at your option offer warranty protection in 
exchange for a fee.<br>
<br>
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or 
any portion<br>
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy 
and<br>
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of 
Section 1<br>
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent 
notices<br>
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any 
change.<br>
<br>
    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or 
publish, that in<br>
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the 
Program or any<br>
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to 
all third<br>
    parties under the terms of this License.<br>
<br>
    c) If the modified program normally reads commands 
interactively<br>
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for 
such<br>
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or 
display an<br>
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice 
and a<br>
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that 
you provide<br>
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program 
under<br>
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a 
copy of this<br>
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is 
interactive but<br>
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work 
based on<br>
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)<br>
<br>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  
If<br>
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the 
Program,<br>
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate 
works in<br>
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply 
to those<br>
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But 
when you<br>
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a 
work based<br>
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on 
the terms of<br>
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend 
to the<br>
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of 
who wrote it.<br>
<br>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights 
or contest<br>
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the 
intent is to<br>
exercise the right to control the distribution of 
derivative or<br>
collective works based on the Program.<br>
<br>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on 
the Program<br>
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a 
volume of<br>
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other 
work under<br>
the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work 
based on it,<br>
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under 
the terms of<br>
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the 
following:<br>
<br>
    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-
readable<br>
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms 
of Sections<br>
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software 
interchange; or,<br>
<br>
    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at 
least three<br>
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more 
than your<br>
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a 
complete<br>
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, 
to be<br>
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above 
on a medium<br>
    customarily used for software interchange; or,<br>
<br>
    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to 
the offer<br>
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This 
alternative is<br>
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if 
you<br>
    received the program in object code or executable form 
with such<br>
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)<br>
<br>
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the 
work for<br>
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, 
complete source<br>
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, 
plus any<br>
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts 
used to<br>
control compilation and installation of the executable.  
However, as a<br>
special exception, the source code distributed need not 
include<br>
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or 
binary<br>
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so 
on) of the<br>
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that 
component<br>
itself accompanies the executable.<br>
<br>
If distribution of executable or object code is made by 
offering<br>
access to copy from a designated place, then offering 
equivalent<br>
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as<br>
distribution of the source code, even though third parties 
are not<br>
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br>
<br>
  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute 
the Program<br>
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any 
attempt<br>
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the 
Program is<br>
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under 
this License.<br>
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from 
you under<br>
this License will not have their licenses terminated so 
long as such<br>
parties remain in full compliance.<br>
<br>
  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you 
have not<br>
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to 
modify or<br>
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These 
actions are<br>
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  
Therefore, by<br>
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on 
the<br>
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to 
do so, and<br>
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or 
modifying<br>
the Program or works based on it.<br>
<br>
  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work 
based on the<br>
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license 
from the<br>
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program 
subject to<br>
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further<br>
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights 
granted herein.<br>
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third 
parties to<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation 
of patent<br>
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent 
issues),<br>
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, 
agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, 
they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you 
cannot<br>
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations 
under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a 
consequence you<br>
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a 
patent<br>
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the 
Program by<br>
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through 
you, then<br>
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License 
would be to<br>
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.<br>
<br>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or 
unenforceable under<br>
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is 
intended to<br>
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in 
other<br>
circumstances.<br>
<br>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to 
infringe any<br>
patents or other property right claims or to contest 
validity of any<br>
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of 
protecting the<br>
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is<br>
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have 
made<br>
generous contributions to the wide range of software 
distributed<br>
through that system in reliance on consistent application 
of that<br>
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she 
is willing<br>
to distribute software through any other system and a 
licensee cannot<br>
impose that choice.<br>
<br>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is 
believed to<br>
be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br>
<br>
  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is 
restricted in<br>
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted 
interfaces, the<br>
original copyright holder who places the Program under this 
License<br>
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation 
excluding<br>
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in 
or among<br>
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License 
incorporates<br>
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.<br>
<br>
  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised 
and/or new versions<br>
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new 
versions will<br>
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ 
in detail to<br>
address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If 
the Program<br>
specifies a version number of this License which applies to 
it and "any<br>
later version", you have the option of following the terms 
and conditions<br>
either of that version or of any later version published by 
the Free<br>
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a 
version number of<br>
this License, you may choose any version ever published by 
the Free Software<br>
Foundation.<br>
<br>
  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into 
other free<br>
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write 
to the author<br>
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted 
by the Free<br>
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; 
we sometimes<br>
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by 
the two goals<br>
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our 
free software and<br>
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.<br>
<br>
                            NO WARRANTY<br>
<br>
  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE 
IS NO WARRANTY<br>
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE 
LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN<br>
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR 
OTHER PARTIES<br>
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, 
EITHER EXPRESSED<br>
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED 
WARRANTIES OF<br>
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE 
ENTIRE RISK AS<br>
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  
SHOULD THE<br>
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL 
NECESSARY SERVICING,<br>
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR 
AGREED TO IN WRITING<br>
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY 
MODIFY AND/OR<br>
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO 
YOU FOR DAMAGES,<br>
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL 
DAMAGES ARISING<br>
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING 
BUT NOT LIMITED<br>
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES 
SUSTAINED BY<br>
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE 
WITH ANY OTHER<br>
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN 
ADVISED OF THE<br>
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br>
<br>
  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of 
the greatest<br>
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is 
to make it<br>
free software which everyone can redistribute and change 
under these terms.<br>
<br>
  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  
It is safest<br>
to attach them to the start of each source file to most 
effectively<br>
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have 
at least<br>
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice 
is found.<br>
<br>

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND 
DISTRIBUTION<br>
<br>
   1. Definitions.<br>
<br>
      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for

authorized by<br>
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.<br>
<br>
      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting

      other entities that control, are controlled by, or 
are under common<br>
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this 
definition,<br>
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to 
cause the<br>
      direction or management of such entity, whether by 
contract or<br>
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) 
or more of the<br>
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of 
such entity.<br>

Entity<br>
      exercising permissions granted by this License.<br>
<br>
      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for

      including but not limited to software source code, 
documentation<br>
      source, and configuration files.<br>
<br>
      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from 
mechanical<br>
      transformation or translation of a Source form, 
including but<br>
      not limited to compiled object code, generated 
documentation,<br>
      and conversions to other media types.<br>
<br>
      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in 
Source or<br>
      Object form, made available under the License, as 
indicated by a<br>
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to 
the work<br>
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).<br>
<br>
      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in 
Source or Object<br>
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and 
for which the<br>
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or 
other modifications<br>
      represent, as a whole, an original work of 
authorship. For the purposes<br>
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include 
works that remain<br>
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to 
the interfaces of,<br>
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.<br>
<br>
      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, 
including<br>
      the original version of the Work and any 
modifications or additions<br>
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is 
intentionally<br>
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by 
the copyright owner<br>
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to 
submit on behalf of<br>
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this 
definition, "submitted"<br>
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written 
communication sent<br>
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but 
not limited to<br>
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source 
code control systems,<br>
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on 
behalf of, the<br>
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving 
the Work, but<br>
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked 
or otherwise<br>
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not 
a Contribution."<br>
<br>
      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual 
or Legal Entity<br>
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by 
Licensor and<br>
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.<br>
<br>
   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and 
conditions of<br>
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a 
perpetual,<br>
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, 
irrevocable<br>
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative 
Works of,<br>
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and 
distribute the<br>
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object 
form.<br>
<br>
   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and 
conditions of<br>
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a 
perpetual,<br>
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, 
irrevocable<br>
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to 
make, have made,<br>
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise 
transfer the Work,<br>
      where such license applies only to those patent 
claims licensable<br>
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by 
their<br>
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their 
Contribution(s)<br>
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was 
submitted. If You<br>
      institute patent litigation against any entity 
(including a<br>
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging 
that the Work<br>
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work 
constitutes direct<br>
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent 
licenses<br>
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall 
terminate<br>
      as of the date such litigation is filed.<br>
<br>
   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute 
copies of the<br>
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with 
or without<br>
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided 
that You<br>
      meet the following conditions:<br>
<br>
      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or<br>
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and<br>
<br>
      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry 
prominent notices<br>
          stating that You changed the files; and<br>
<br>
      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any 
Derivative Works<br>
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, 
trademark, and<br>
          attribution notices from the Source form of the 
Work,<br>
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to 
any part of<br>
          the Derivative Works; and<br>
<br>
      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part 
of its<br>
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You 
distribute must<br>
          include a readable copy of the attribution 
notices contained<br>
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices 
that do not<br>
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in 
at least one<br>
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text 
file distributed<br>
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the 
Source form or<br>
          documentation, if provided along with the 
Derivative Works; or,<br>
          within a display generated by the Derivative 
Works, if and<br>
          wherever such third-party notices normally 
appear. The contents<br>
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes 
only and<br>
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own 
attribution<br>
          notices within Derivative Works that You 
distribute, alongside<br>
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the 
Work, provided<br>
          that such additional attribution notices cannot 
be construed<br>
          as modifying the License.<br>
<br>
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your 
modifications and<br>
      may provide additional or different license terms and 
conditions<br>
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your 
modifications, or<br>
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided 
Your use,<br>
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise 
complies with<br>
      the conditions stated in this License.<br>
<br>
   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly 
state otherwise,<br>
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for 
inclusion in the Work<br>
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and 
conditions of<br>
      this License, without any additional terms or 
conditions.<br>
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall 
supersede or modify<br>
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may 
have executed<br>
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br>
<br>
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to 
use the trade<br>
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of 
the Licensor,<br>
      except as required for reasonable and customary use 
in describing the<br>
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the 
NOTICE file.<br>
<br>
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable 
law or<br>
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and 
each<br>
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" 
BASIS,<br>
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either 
express or<br>
      implied, including, without limitation, any 
warranties or conditions<br>
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or 
FITNESS FOR A<br>
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for 
determining the<br>
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work 
and assume any<br>
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions 
under this License.<br>
<br>
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no 
legal theory,<br>
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or 
otherwise,<br>
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate 
and grossly<br>
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any 
Contributor be<br>
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, 
indirect, special,<br>
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character 
arising as a<br>
      result of this License or out of the use or inability 
to use the<br>
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss 
of goodwill,<br>
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or 
any and all<br>
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such 
Contributor<br>
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br>
<br>
   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While 
redistributing<br>
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose 
to offer,<br>
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, 
warranty, indemnity,<br>
      or other liability obligations and/or rights 
consistent with this<br>
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You 
may act only<br>
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, 
not on behalf<br>
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to 
indemnify,<br>
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any 
liability<br>
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such 
Contributor by reason<br>
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional 
liability.<br>
<br>
   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>

<br>
Strawberry Perl V5.12.3.0<br>
<br>
Artistic License:<br>
<br>
The Program includes some or all of the following that IBM 
obtained under the Artistic License:<br>
<br>
Strawberry Perl V5.12.3.0<br>
<br>
			 The "Artistic License"<br>
<br>
				Preamble<br>
<br>
The intent of this document is to state the conditions 
under which a<br>
Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder 
maintains some<br>
semblance of artistic control over the development of the 
package,<br>
while giving the users of the package the right to use and 
distribute<br>
the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the 
right to make<br>
reasonable modifications.<br>
<br>
Definitions:<br>
<br>
	"Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by 
the<br>
	Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of 
files<br>
	created through textual modification.<br>
<br>
	"Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not 
been<br>
	modified, or has been modified in accordance with the 
wishes<br>
	of the Copyright Holder as specified below.<br>
<br>
	"Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or<br>
	copyrights for the package.<br>
<br>
	"You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or 
distributing<br>
	this Package.<br>
<br>
	"Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the<br>
	basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people 
involved,<br>
	and so on.  (You will not be required to justify it to the<br>
	Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at 
large<br>
	as a market that must bear the fee.)<br>
<br>
	"Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the 
item<br>
	itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the 
item.<br>
	It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute 
it<br>
	under the same conditions they received it.<br>
<br>
1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source 
form of the<br>
Standard Version of this Package without restriction, 
provided that you<br>
duplicate all of the original copyright notices and 
associated disclaimers.<br>
<br>
2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other 
modifications<br>
derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright 
Holder.  A Package<br>
modified in such a way shall still be considered the 
Standard Version.<br>
<br>
3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in 
any way, provided<br>
that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file 
stating how and<br>
when you changed that file, and provided that you do at 
least ONE of the<br>
following:<br>
<br>
    a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or 
otherwise make them<br>
    Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications 
to Usenet or<br>
    an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a 
major archive<br>
    site such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright 
Holder to include<br>
    your modifications in the Standard Version of the 
Package.<br>
<br>
    b) use the modified Package only within your 
corporation or organization.<br>
<br>
    c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do 
not conflict<br>
    with standard executables, which must also be provided, 
and provide<br>
    a separate manual page for each non-standard executable 
that clearly<br>
    documents how it differs from the Standard Version.<br>
<br>
    d) make other distribution arrangements with the 
Copyright Holder.<br>
<br>
4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in 
object code or<br>
executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the 
following:<br>
<br>
    a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and 
library files,<br>
    together with instructions (in the manual page or 
equivalent) on where<br>
    to get the Standard Version.<br>
<br>
    b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable 
source of<br>
    the Package with your modifications.<br>
<br>
    c) give non-standard executables non-standard names, 
and clearly<br>
    document the differences in manual pages (or 
equivalent), together<br>
    with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.<br>
<br>
    d) make other distribution arrangements with the 
Copyright Holder.<br>
<br>
5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any 
distribution of this<br>
Package.  You may charge any fee you choose for support of 
this<br>
Package.  You may not charge a fee for this Package 
itself.  However,<br>
you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other 
(possibly<br>
commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly 
commercial) software<br>
distribution provided that you do not advertise this 
Package as a<br>
product of your own.  You may embed this Package's 
interpreter within<br>
an executable of yours (by linking); this shall be 
construed as a mere<br>
form of aggregation, provided that the complete Standard 
Version of the<br>
interpreter is so embedded.<br>
<br>
6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or 
produced as<br>
output from the programs of this Package do not 
automatically fall<br>
under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whoever 
generated<br>
them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated 
with this<br>
Package.  If such scripts or library files are aggregated 
with this<br>
Package via the so-called "undump" or "unexec" methods of 
producing a<br>
binary executable image, then distribution of such an image 
shall<br>
neither be construed as a distribution of this Package nor 
shall it<br>
fall under the restrictions of Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided 
that you do<br>
not represent such an executable image as a Standard 
Version of this<br>
Package.<br>
<br>
7. C subroutines (or comparably compiled subroutines in 
other<br>
languages) supplied by you and linked into this Package in 
order to<br>
emulate subroutines and variables of the language defined 
by this<br>
Package shall not be considered part of this Package, but 
are the<br>
equivalent of input as in Paragraph 6, provided these 
subroutines do<br>
not change the language in any way that would cause it to 
fail the<br>
regression tests for the language.<br>
<br>
8. Aggregation of this Package with a commercial 
distribution is always<br>
permitted provided that the use of this Package is 
embedded; that is,<br>
when no overt attempt is made to make this Package's 
interfaces visible<br>
to the end user of the commercial distribution.  Such use 
shall not be<br>
construed as a distribution of this Package.<br>
<br>
9. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to 
endorse or promote<br>
products derived from this software without specific prior 
written permission.<br>
<br>
10. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY 
EXPRESS OR<br>
IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE 
IMPLIED<br>
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR 
PURPOSE.<br>

<br>
Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br>
59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA<br>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim 
copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It 
also counts as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, 
version 2,<br>
hence the version number 2.1.]<br>
<br>
Preamble<br>
<br>
The licenses for most software are designed to take away 
your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU 
General Public <br>
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share 
and change free software--to make sure the software is free for 
all its users.<br>
<br>
This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to 
some specially designated software packages--typically 
libraries--of the<br>
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to 
use it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think 
carefully about <br>
whether this license or the ordinary General Public License 
is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on 
the <br>
explanations below.<br>
<br>
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom 
of use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to 
make sure<br>
that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free 
software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive 
source <br>
code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the 
software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are <br>
informed that you can do these things.<br>
<br>
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that 
forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to 
surrender <br>
these rights. These restrictions translate to certain 
responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you 
modify<br>
it.<br>
<br>
For example, if you distribute copies of the library, 
whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the 
rights that <br>
we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or 
can get the source code. If you link other code with the 
library, you must<br>
provide complete object files to the recipients, so that 
they can relink them with the library after making changes to 
the library <br>
and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so 
they know their rights.<br>
<br>
We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we 
copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives 
you legal<br>
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.<br>
<br>
To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear 
that there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the 
library is <br>
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients 
should know that what they have is not the original version, so 
that the <br>
original author's reputation will not be affected by 
problems that might be introduced by others.<br>
<br>
Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the 
existence of any free program. We wish to make sure that a company 
cannot <br>
effectively restrict the users of a free program by 
obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we 
insist that <br>
any patent license obtained for a version of the library 
must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in 
this license.<br>
<br>
Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by 
the ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU 
Lesser <br>
General Public License, applies to certain designated 
libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public 
License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to 
permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.<br>
<br>
When a program is linked with a library, whether statically 
or using a shared library, the combination of the two is 
legally speaking<br>
a combined work, a derivative of the original library. The 
ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking only 
if <br>
the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The 
Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for 
linking other code<br>
with the library.<br>
<br>
We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License 
because it does Less to protect the user's freedom than the 
ordinary General<br>
Public License. It also provides other free software 
developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs. 
These <br>
disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General 
Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license 
provides advantages in certain special circumstances.<br>
<br>
For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need 
to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so 
that it <br>
becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free 
programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is 
that a free<br>
library does the same job as widely used non-free 
libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free 
library to <br>
free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public 
License.<br>
<br>
In other cases, permission to use a particular library in 
non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a 
large body of<br>
free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C 
Library in non-free programs enables many more people to use the 
whole GNU <br>
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux 
operating system.<br>
Although the Lesser General Public License is Less 
protective of the users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a 
program that <br>
is linked with the Library has the freedom and the 
wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library.<br>
<br>
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution 
and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference 
between a <br>
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the 
library". The former contains code derived from the library, whereas 
the latter<br>
must be combined with the library in order to run.<br>
<br>
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND 
MODIFICATION<br>
<br>
0.  This License Agreement applies to any software library 
or other program which contains a notice placed by the 
copyright holder or<br>
 other authorized party saying it may be distributed under 
the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called 
"this<br>
 License"). Each licensee is addressed as "you".<br>
<br>
 A "library" means a collection of software functions 
and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with 
application programs<br>
 (which use some of those functions and data) to form 
executables.<br>
<br>
 The "Library", below, refers to any such software library 
or work which has been distributed under these terms. A "work 
based on the<br>
 Library" means either the Library or any derivative work 
under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the 
Library or a <br>
 portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications 
and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. 
(Hereinafter,<br>
 translation is included without limitation in the term 
"modification".)<br>
<br>
 "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the 
work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete 
source code <br>
 means all the source code for all modules it contains, 
plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts 
used to<br>
 control compilation and installation of the library.<br>
<br>
 Activities other than copying, distribution and 
modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its 
scope. The act of<br>
 running a program using the Library is not restricted, and 
output from such a program is covered only if its contents 
constitute a <br>
 work based on the Library (independent of the use of the 
Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on 
what the <br>
 Library does and what the program that uses the Library 
does.<br>
<br>
1.  You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the 
Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, 
provided that<br>
 you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy 
an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; 
keep intact all<br>
 the notices that refer to this License and to the absence 
of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along 
with the <br>
 Library.<br>
<br>
 You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring 
a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection 
in exchange <br>
 for a fee.<br>
<br>
2.  You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or 
any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, 
and copy and <br>
 distribute such modifications or work under the terms of 
Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these 
conditions:<br>
<br>
     a)  The modified work must itself be a software 
library.<br>
     b)  You must cause the files modified to carry 
prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of 
any change.<br>
     c)  You must cause the whole of the work to be 
licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this 
License.<br>
     d)  If a facility in the modified Library refers to a 
function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program 
that<br>
uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when 
the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort 
to ensure <br>
that, in the event an application does not supply such 
function or table, the  facility still operates, and performs 
whatever part of <br>
its purpose remains meaningful.<br>
<br>
(For example, a function in a library to compute square 
roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of 
the <br>
application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any 
application-supplied function or table used by this function must be 
optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root 
function must still compute square roots.)<br>
<br>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. 
If identifiable sections of that  work are not derived from 
the Library, <br>
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate 
works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not 
apply to those<br>
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But 
when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which 
is a work <br>
based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be 
on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other 
licensees extend<br>
to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part 
regardless of who wrote it.<br>
<br>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights 
or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; 
rather, the intent<br>
is to exercise the right to control the distribution of 
derivative or collective works based on the Library.<br>
<br>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on 
the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the 
Library) on a <br>
volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring 
the other work under the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
3.  You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU 
General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of 
the Library.<br>
To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to 
this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General 
Public License,<br>
version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version 
than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has 
appeared,<br>
then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do 
not make any other change in these notices.<br>
<br>
Once this change is made in a given copy, it is 
irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License 
applies to <br>
all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that 
copy.<br>
<br>
This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the 
code of the Library into a program that is not a library.<br>
<br>
4.  You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion 
or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or 
executable form <br>
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you 
accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source 
code, <br>
which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 
2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.<br>
<br>
If distribution of object code is made by offering access 
to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent 
access to copy <br>
the source code from the same place satisfies the 
requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties 
are not <br>
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br>
<br>
5.  A program that contains no derivative of any portion of 
the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being 
compiled <br>
or linked with it, is called a "work that uses the 
Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the 
Library, and <br>
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the 
Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library 
(because<br>
it contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work 
that uses the library". The executable is therefore covered by 
this License<br>
. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such 
executables.<br>
<br>
When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a 
header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the 
work may <br>
be a derivative work of the Library even though the source 
code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if 
the work can<br>
be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a 
library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined 
by law.<br>
<br>
If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data 
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline <br>
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of 
the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is 
legally a <br>
derivative work. (Executables containing this object code 
plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)<br>
<br>
Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you 
may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of 
Section 6.<br>
Any executables containing that work also fall under 
Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library 
itself.<br>
<br>
6.  As an exception to the Sections above, you may also 
combine or link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to 
produce a<br>
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute 
that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms 
permit <br>
modification of the work for the customer's own use and 
reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.<br>
<br>
You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work 
that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use 
are <br>
covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this 
License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, 
you must <br>
include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as 
well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this 
License. Also, <br>
you must do one of these things:<br>
<br>
a)  Accompany the work with the complete corresponding 
machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever 
changes were <br>
used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 
1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with 
the Library,<br>
with the complete machine-readable "work that uses the 
Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can 
modify the <br>
Library and then relink to produce a modified executable 
containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who 
changes<br>
the contents of definitions files in the Library will not 
necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified <br>
definitions.)<br>
b)  Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking 
with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at 
run time a <br>
copy of the library already present on the user's computer 
system, rather than copying library functions into the executable, 
and (2) <br>
will operate properly with a modified version of the 
library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version 
is <br>
interface-compatible with the version that the work was 
made with.<br>
c)  Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at 
least three years, to give the same user the materials specified 
in <br>
Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of 
performing this distribution.<br>
d)  If distribution of the work is made by offering access 
to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to 
copy the above<br>
specified materials from the same place.<br>
e)  Verify that the user has already received a copy of 
these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.<br>
<br>
For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses 
the Library" must include any data and utility programs needed 
for <br>
reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special 
exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything 
that is<br>
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with 
the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the 
operating system<br>
on which the executable runs, unless that component itself 
accompanies the executable.<br>
<br>
It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license 
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally <br>
accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means 
you cannot use both them and the Library together in an 
executable that you<br>
distribute.<br>
<br>
7.  You may place library facilities that are a work based 
on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with 
other <br>
library facilities not covered by this License, and 
distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate 
distribution of the <br>
work based on the Library and of the other library 
facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two 
things:<br>
<br>
a)  Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same 
work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library 
facilities. <br>
This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections 
above.<br>
b)  Give prominent notice with the combined library of the 
fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and 
explaining where<br>
to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br>
<br>
8.  You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or 
distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this 
License. Any <br>
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, 
or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically 
terminate your <br>
rights under this License. However, parties who have 
received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not 
have their <br>
licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full 
compliance.<br>
<br>
9.  You are not required to accept this License, since you 
have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission 
to modify<br>
or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These 
actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. 
Therefore,<br>
by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based 
on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License 
to do so, <br>
and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing 
or modifying the Library or works based on it.<br>
<br>
10.  Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work 
based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a 
license from <br>
the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or 
modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may 
not impose <br>
any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the 
rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing 
compliance by<br>
third parties with this License.<br>
<br>
11.  If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation 
of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to 
patent <br>
issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court 
order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of 
this License,<br>
they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. 
If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your 
obligations<br>
under this License and any other pertinent obligations, 
then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. 
For example, <br>
if a patent license would not permit royalty-free 
redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or 
indirectly <br>
through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it 
and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution 
of the <br>
Library.<br>
<br>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or 
unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the 
section is <br>
intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended 
to apply in other circumstances.<br>
<br>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to 
infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest 
validity of<br>
any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of 
protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system 
which is <br>
implemented by public license practices. Many people have 
made generous contributions to the wide range of software 
distributed <br>
through that system in reliance on consistent application 
of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he 
or she is <br>
willing to distribute software through any other system and 
a licensee cannot impose that choice.<br>
<br>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is 
believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br>
<br>
12.  If the distribution and/or use of the Library is 
restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted 
interfaces,<br>
the original copyright holder who places the Library under 
this License may add an explicit geographical distribution 
limitation <br>
excluding those countries, so that distribution is 
permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, 
this License<br>
incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of 
this License.<br>
<br>
13.  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised 
and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time 
to time. <br>
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present 
version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or 
concerns.<br>
<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If 
the Library specifies a version number of this License which 
applies to it<br>
and "any later version", you have the option of following 
the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later 
version <br>
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library 
does not specify a license version number, you may choose any 
version ever <br>
published by the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
14.  If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into 
other free programs whose distribution conditions are 
incompatible with <br>
these, write to the author to ask for permission. For 
software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write 
to the Free <br>
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. 
Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the 
free status<br>
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting 
the sharing and reuse of software generally.<br>
<br>
NO WARRANTY<br>
<br>
15.  BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE 
IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY 
APPLICABLE LAW.<br>
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT 
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT 
WARRANTY OF <br>
ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT 
LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS 
FOR A <br>
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND 
PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE 
DEFECTIVE,<br>
YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR 
CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
16.  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR 
AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY 
WHO MAY <br>
MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, 
BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, 
INCIDENTAL OR <br>
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY 
TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA 
OR DATA BEING <br>
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD 
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER 
SOFTWARE), EVEN<br>
IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE 
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries<br>
<br>
If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the 
greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it free 
software<br>
that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by 
permitting redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under 
the<br>
terms of the ordinary General Public License).<br>
<br>
To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the 
library. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source 
file to <br>
most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each 
file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to 
where the <br>
full notice is found.<br>
<br>
one line to give the library's name and an idea of what it 
does.<br>
Copyright (C) year  name of author<br>
This library is free software; you can redistribute it 
and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public 
License as <br>
published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 
2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.<br>
<br>
This library is distributed in the hope that it will be 
useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty 
of <br>
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See 
the GNU Lesser General Public License for more details.<br>
<br>
You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General 
Public License along with this library; if not, write to the Free 
Software<br>
Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  
02111-1307  USA<br>
<br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic 
and paper mail.<br>
<br>
You should also get your employer (if you work as a 
programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" 
for the <br>
library, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:<br>
<br>

                       Version 3, 29 June 2007<br>
<br>
 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http:
//fsf.org/><br>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim 
copies<br>
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
<br>
  This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License 
incorporates<br>
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General 
Public<br>
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed 
below.<br>
<br>
  0. Additional Definitions.<br>
<br>
  As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the 
GNU Lesser<br>
General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 
3 of the GNU<br>
General Public License.<br>
<br>
  "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this 
License,<br>
other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined 
below.<br>
<br>
  An "Application" is any work that makes use of an 
interface provided<br>
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the 
Library.<br>
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is 
deemed a mode<br>
of using an interface provided by the Library.<br>
<br>
  A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or 
linking an<br>
Application with the Library.  The particular version of 
the Library<br>
with which the Combined Work was made is also called the 
"Linked<br>
Version".<br>
<br>
  The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work 
means the<br>
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any 
source code<br>
for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in 
isolation, are<br>
based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.<br>
<br>
  The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work 
means the<br>
object code and/or source code for the Application, 
including any data<br>
and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined 
Work from the<br>
Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the 
Combined Work.<br>
<br>
  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.<br>
<br>
  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of 
this License<br>
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.<br>
<br>
  2. Conveying Modified Versions.<br>
<br>
  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your 
modifications, a<br>
facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an 
Application<br>
that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed 
when the<br>
facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the 
modified<br>
version:<br>
<br>
   a) under this License, provided that you make a good 
faith effort to<br>
   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply 
the<br>
   function or data, the facility still operates, and 
performs<br>
   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or<br>
<br>
   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional 
permissions of<br>
   this License applicable to that copy.<br>
<br>
  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header 
Files.<br>
<br>
  The object code form of an Application may incorporate 
material from<br>
a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey 
such object<br>
code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the 
incorporated<br>
material is not limited to numerical parameters, data 
structure<br>
layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions 
and templates<br>
(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the 
following:<br>
<br>
   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object 
code that the<br>
   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use 
are<br>
   covered by this License.<br>
<br>
   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL 
and this license<br>
   document.<br>
<br>
  4. Combined Works.<br>
<br>
  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice 
that,<br>
taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of 
the<br>
portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and 
reverse<br>
engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also 
do each of<br>
the following:<br>
<br>
   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined 
Work that<br>
   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its 
use are<br>
   covered by this License.<br>
<br>
   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU 
GPL and this license<br>
   document.<br>
<br>
   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices 
during<br>
   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library 
among<br>
   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user 
to the<br>
   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.<br>
<br>
   d) Do one of the following:<br>
<br>
       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the 
terms of this<br>
       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a 
form<br>
       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user 
to<br>
       recombine or relink the Application with a modified 
version of<br>
       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined 
Work, in the<br>
       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for 
conveying<br>
       Corresponding Source.<br>
<br>
       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for 
linking with the<br>
       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses 
at run time<br>
       a copy of the Library already present on the user's 
computer<br>
       system, and (b) will operate properly with a 
modified version<br>
       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the 
Linked<br>
       Version.<br>
<br>
   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you 
would otherwise<br>
   be required to provide such information under section 6 
of the<br>
   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is<br>
   necessary to install and execute a modified version of 
the<br>
   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the<br>
   Application with a modified version of the Linked 
Version. (If<br>
   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must 
accompany<br>
   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding 
Application<br>
   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the 
Installation<br>
   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the 
GNU GPL<br>
   for conveying Corresponding Source.)<br>
<br>
  5. Combined Libraries.<br>
<br>
  You may place library facilities that are a work based on 
the<br>
Library side by side in a single library together with 
other library<br>
facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by 
this<br>
License, and convey such a combined library under terms of 
your<br>
choice, if you do both of the following:<br>
<br>
   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the 
same work based<br>
   on the Library, uncombined with any other library 
facilities,<br>
   conveyed under the terms of this License.<br>
<br>
   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that 
part of it<br>
   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to 
find the<br>
   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br>
<br>
  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public 
License.<br>
<br>
  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or 
new versions<br>
of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. 
Such new<br>
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, 
but may<br>
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If 
the<br>
Library as you received it specifies that a certain 
numbered version<br>
of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later 
version"<br>
applies to it, you have the option of following the terms 
and<br>
conditions either of that published version or of any later 
version<br>
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library 
as you<br>
received it does not specify a version number of the GNU 
Lesser<br>
General Public License, you may choose any version of the 
GNU Lesser<br>
General Public License ever published by the Free Software 
Foundation.<br>
<br>
  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy 
can decide<br>
whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public 
License shall<br>
apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any 
version is<br>
permanent authorization for you to choose that version for 
the<br>
Library.<br>
